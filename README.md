# Word-Guess-Game
This is a classic hangman style word guessing game with a Pokemon theme! As letters are typed on the keyboard, the matching letters in the word will be revealed. Fill in the correct Pokemon, then the Pokemon's image is revealed. If the player makes 13 incorrect letter guesses, they lose and the Pokemon flees.
